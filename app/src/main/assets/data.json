The programs offered by AUPP with U of A and FHSU are “dual degrees”, meaning that students who finish four years of study at AUPP will receive one bachelor's degree from AUPP and another from the American Partner University. This agreement also allows AUPP students to study abroad at UA or at FHSU in the United States for one or two semesters, depending on their choice of major.",
